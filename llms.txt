## Queryable API Overview

The Queryable API provides a type-safe, chainable way to find game entities:

```java
// Example: Find nearest banker NPC
Rs2NpcModel banker = rs2NpcCache.query()
    .withName("Banker")
    .nearest();

// Example: Find valuable ground items
Rs2TileItemModel loot = rs2TileItemCache.query()
    .where(item -> item.getTotalGeValue() >= 5000)
    .nearest(10);
```

Available caches:
- Rs2NpcCache - Query NPCs
- Rs2TileItemCache - Query ground items
- Rs2PlayerCache - Query players
- Rs2TileObjectCache - Query game objects (trees, rocks, banks)
